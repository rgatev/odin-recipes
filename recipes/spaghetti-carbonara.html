        <h1>How to Make Carbonara Step-By-Step</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; place
                squash on top, cut-side down.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until skin is easily pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>While squash is cooking, fry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, 5 to 10
                minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving grease in skillet. Crumble bacon when cool
                enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Cool baked squash until easily handled. Scrape flesh into noodles using a fork. Place noodles and garlic
                in the skillet with the reserved bacon grease. Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes; reduce heat to low.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk eggs and Parmesan cheese together in a small bowl; add to skillet and stir continuously for 3
                minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cooked bacon pieces, parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve immediately.
            </li>
